# FAQÂ·SNS


## What is the logic of token (KEY) allocation for SNS domains?

The domain name allocation token (KEY) logic is always allocated to the current holder address of the domain name for bookkeeping purposes. When a domain name is traded, access to the KEY is also transferred to the new holder address. However, the credited KEY will not be transferred to the new holder address, but will still be assigned to the original holder.


## Why are domain names registered but not displayed in Opensea with domain images and other information?
Opensea, Rarible and other NFT trading platforms all display domain name information by reading metadata of SNS domain names on IPFS, but IPFS reading is a heavy work for the trading market, because there are a lot of IPFS metadata to be read and stored in the database of the trading market every day, so after registering a domain name, the domain name information is not displayed on Opensea The solution is very simple, you just need to click Refresh on Opensea's NFT details page, and the NFT information will be loaded after about a few minutes.
