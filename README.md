LINKKEY is a universal protocol for building WEB3 social circles, SNS personal domain name service to create a social circle identity system, LINKNFT contract to define the relationship between friends and groups, LINKCHAT to achieve encrypted communication between friends & groups, LINKPOST to build a social circle interaction between friends.

Linkkey received an [official Grant from Polygon](https://twitter.com/Polygon_Space1/status/1472628456471302144) in the end of 2021, and Polygon provided us with a series of assistance to successfully incubate Linkkey as the #1 ranked Polygon Chain Domain Web3 project category.

Since September 2021, our core team has been discussing the SocialFi opportunity internally, and through almost weekly offline sharing discussions, we finally agreed on the direction to use web3 personal social domains (SNS - Social Name System) as the entry point We then used SNS as the Web3 identity carrier to open decentralized private circle chatting and social interaction based on the NFT holding relationship between SNS social domains by issuing exclusive NFTs.

In a word, we are trying to build a blockchain-based, completely decentralized Web3 private social circle. This will bring a private social network with autonomous control and censorship resistance to the citizens of Web3. It is not built for everyone, it focuses on small social circles, and it expects to build a value network in a limited number of social circles.
