# Group-NFT

Group-NFT is a social supplement to Friend-NFT, we have 1v1 social needs, but also a group of like-minded people for group social needs, so we also launched the Group section, for up to 1500 people to build a large social circle.



The prerequisite for issuing Group-NFT (GNFT for short below) is: having an SNS domain name and completing Twitter identity verification.



GNFT basic information:

- NFT quantity is 1500

- Fixed floor price, default KEY as currency unit, will open other currencies later

- Can set the number of external public sales (primary market, open to the public Mint)

- Secondary trading is possible

- Can set the name of the contract group, easy to spread and remember

After issuing GNFT:

- SNS can no longer be traded and will be locked into designated contracts to avoid fraud and false issues

- FNFT can still be issued

- The unpublicized portion will be minted to your own address
